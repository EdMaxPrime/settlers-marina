a road segment is defined as a path through the graph until you reach
an intersection where there is a fork in your OWN road or your road ends
(connections which are your own != 1)

intersections = {
	Intersection* : {
		building: <Player* owner, C|S type> or null,
		roads: [<Player* owner, R|S type, Intersection* next>]
	}
}

longestRoad = 0 //game global

addRoad(road) {
	let visited = {};
	int r1 = findLongest(road.a, visited);
	int r2 = findLongest(road.b, visited);
	if(r1 + r2 > longestRoad)
		longestRoad = r1 + r2;
		!we have a new longest road!
}

int findLongest(Player p, Intersection start, visited) {
	if visited or has enemy building
		return 0
	int r1, r2, r3 = 0;
	visited[start] = true;
	for each of the three connections this intersection has:
		if road has same owner
			r[i] = 1 + findLongest(nextIntersection, visited);
	return max(r1, r2, r3);
}

addBuilding(settlement s) {
	//break up longest road?
	let visited = {s.location};
	for each of the connections this intersection has:
		if road has a different owner
